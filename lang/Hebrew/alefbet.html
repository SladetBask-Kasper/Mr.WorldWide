        <h3>Is it a difficult script to learn?</h3>
        <p>
          The hebrew alphabet is sometimes treated as much harder than it actually is.
          The alphabet is called "Alef bet" or "Alif bet" depending on which sound you think the letter "י - Yod" that makes a
          y/i/j sound which might at first sound quite difficult to know which to use, but in reality the J & Y both represent the
          same sound, like the J in Julia, and so you could make it even easier to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in other words the character "Yod" makes either a y/i/e sound. "i" is similar to both so for most of the the
          pronounciation will come naturally. So don't worry about the two to four almost identical or in some cases (like with j/y)
          exactly identical sounds.

        <h3>What does "Alef bet" mean?</h3>
        <p>
          So "Alef bet" is just the name of the first two letters of the alphabet. Just like our word in english "Alphabet" is just
          the name of the first to letters of the Greek alphabet (which the roman one is based upon): Alpha Beta.

      <h3>Some important Niqqud (נִקּוּד‎)</h3><br>
      <h4>What is Niqqud?</h4>
      <p>
        Niqqud is a way of being more specific about what letters
        make what sound. You might have seen some of the characters
        such as Ayin, Vav and Bet have a number of sound. Niqqud
        is the way we'll be able to tell the diffrence
      </p>
      <h4>Bet/Vet</h4>
      <p>
        The Second letter of the alphabet is a kinda tricky but also
        probably the easiest to remeber. It has two major pronounciations that you'll
        need to care about. Bet (בּ‎) and Vet (ב). If there is a dot in
        the middle it is always similar to a "B" sound. Otherwise, assuming the text
        has Niqqud, it is probably a "V" sound. If the text doesn't have Niqqud then
        there really is no other way of telling other than learning how it's pronounced.
      </p>
      <h4>Vav</h4>
      <p>
        Vav with a dot in the middle, on the left (וּ) and with a dot on top (וֹ‎) are the two
        importaint ones to know. If there is text with Niqqud and there is no dot on the Vav
        then it is probably making a "V" sound simply. If its got a dot on middle left (וּ)
        then it makes a U or Å sound. If it has a dot on top (וֹ‎) it makes an "O" sound.
      </p>
      <h4>Ayin</h4>
      <p>
        Ayin is probably one of the most difficult letters on this list. If only it
        was as in Yiddish where it more or less always makes an "e" sound. However, you
        might see all kinds of crazy Niqqud with Ayin. So two general rules of thumb,
        is that if there is a line under the Ayin, like in עֲ or עַ then it works like
        an "A" sound. And if there is dots under with no line, like in עֵ then it is
        usually pronounced as an "E" sound, or as an "I" sound, primarialy an "I"
        sound in other languages, which in english should be kinda like "ee" in for
        example "meet". It might be kinda wierd when i say the the sound for dots but
        no line is something like e/i/ee but i/ee are the same sound and e and ee aren't
        far from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes in old texts, Ayin in general, but specifically with a line under it can,
        make a "G" sound. So for
        example, the Palestinian city of Gaza inside the Gaza strip would be spelled "עַזָּה‎"
        in Hebrew. This word would be pronounced in modern hebrew as "Azah". In old Hebrew
        it would be pronounced kinda like "G" and there would be an "a" sound added between
        Ayin and Zign. So it would be, in old Hebrew, pronounced as "Gazah". The Arabic
        language has it's own version of Niqqud and it has a specific way of writing Ayin
        with a G sound and the Arabic spelling of Gaza is with that Ġain (G sound Ayin),
        and that is why we spell it "Gaza" in the west, because it's a transliteration of
        the Arabic spelling.
